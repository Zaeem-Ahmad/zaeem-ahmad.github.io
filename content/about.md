I recently finished my second year of [electrical engineering](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. Throughout my studies, I've gained interest in a range of topics, which includes electromagnetics, digital and embedded systems, systems software, and computer hardware. Next year, I want to learn about operating systems, energy systems, and control systems (lots of systems, yes) as well as computer networks and cybersecurity.

The above notwithstanding, I also have a knack for reading all genres of fiction, from epic fantasies and thrillers to contemporary and historical fiction. I am also invested in the study of languages, religion, and history. I enjoy playing basketball, going on bike rides, and taking walks with my friends.

If you want to get in touch (or have some tea with me), feel free to email me.
