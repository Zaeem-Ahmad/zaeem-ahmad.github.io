### About my Program

Some quick thoughts about my degree: I think Electrical Engineering (aka "ECE") at U of T is a pretty good program. It's challenging, no doubt, but it's also quite rewarding in the way it exposes you to different areas of ECE. The first two years, called "foundation years", drill into you the fundamental knowledge required for upper years. You learn a lot about yourself in the process, such as what study methods work best for you and how to perform under pressure.
